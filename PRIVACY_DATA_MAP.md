# Toj Privacy Data Map

This file is the repository source of truth for `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`, App Store Connect privacy answers, and the published privacy policy. Every row beginning with an `NSPrivacyCollectedDataType` identifier is machine-checked by `scripts/verify-privacy-manifest.py`.

All listed data is used for app functionality and is not used for tracking. “Linked” means the service can associate the retained data with a Toj account. Retention is bounded by account deletion, message deletion, or the server cleanup policies described below; production policy text must publish the same rules before App Store submission.

## Field-level collection map

This table is the human-reviewable release inventory. “None” in the processor column means the data
does not leave Toj-controlled services through that collection path. Authentication, authorization,
rate-limit, and deduplication receipts are covered separately from the de-identified metric payload
they protect.

## Explicit exclusions in the current release

- Coarse-only location as a separate collection category: location sharing can receive precise coordinates, so the more protective precise-location declaration is used.
- Search history: message search is performed and stored locally on the device.
- Advertising and tracking: Toj has no advertising or cross-company tracking path; `NSPrivacyTracking` is false.
- Crash data: no crash-reporting SDK is currently shipped.
- Live call media: call audio/video is handled in real time and is not retained as collected call content. Uploaded voice notes and chat media are declared separately above.

Any change that adds one of these flows must update this map, the manifest, App Store Connect answers, and the public privacy policy in the same release.
