///
/// - ``start()`` bootstraps and kicks off background draining.
/// - ``drainBeforeSearch()`` is the bounded foreground path: it runs on a keystroke, so it is
///   capped and gives up rather than blocking.
/// - The background loop drains the live queue to empty, then advances the backfill one page at a
///   time, yielding between units so a send never waits behind history from 2019.
/// - ``runMaintenance()`` folds in the audit and the tombstone merge, for a BGTask to call.
